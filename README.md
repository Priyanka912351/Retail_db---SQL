# Retail_db---SQL

❓ Problem Statement

Built an ETL pipeline to extract, transform, and load retail store data into a structured database. Using SQL queries analyzed consumer behavior, sales trends, and operational performance to derive meaningful insights that help in decision-making for a retail business.

📊 Data Points Used

The dataset includes information on:

Customers: Customer details such as ID, Name, Gender, City, State.

Stores: Store ID, Location details (City, Area, State).

Products: Product ID, Category, Price.

Orders: Order ID, Customer ID, Store ID, Order Date, Total Amount.

Order Mapping: Links Orders to Products, including Order ID, Product ID, and Quantity.


⚙️ Technology Stack
ETL Pipeline: Extract, transform(Using Excel), and load data

SQL: Data transformation and analysis

Excel: For initial data formatting before loading into SQL

Database Management: Structured storage of retail data


🏗️ Methodology

Format Data: Clean and structure raw data using Excel.

Load into SQL: Import formatted data into a SQL database.

Data Transformation: Create relationships between tables using keys (e.g., Customers → Orders → Order Mapping → Products).

SQL Querying & Analysis: Perform aggregations, joins, and conditional computations.


📈 SQL Querying & Data Analysis

Key SQL Operations Used:

Aggregation (SUM, COUNT, AVG) for sales and revenue analysis

Joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) to connect customers, transactions, and stores

Conditional Columns (CASE WHEN) to classify transactions

Filtering (WHERE, HAVING) for targeted insights

Grouping & Sorting (Group By , ORDER BY) to group & rank performance metrics
